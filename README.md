Republia Blockchain and Smart-Contracts open source code. 

Republia is a decentralized ecosystem, that within one project combines all operating mechanisms of blockchain technology, that are in demand in the industry. The ecosystem is based on an innovative technology, which, in turn, buttressed by a proprietary blockchain, implemented using the functional programming language - OCaml.

Consensus Republia operates on an improved algorithm Republia-Delegated-Proof-of-Authority (RDPoA) + BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerance). Algorithm RPoA operates on the basis of RepubliaID verification and helps to avoid attacks, because users own unique RepubliaID, which ensures the reliability of each ecosystem participant and the confidence that one participant within the framework of voting for modernization of both technological and ideological decisions will be able to vote only once.
